                        <p>It is also your sole responsibility to ensure that the laws applicable to you do not prohibit
                            you from participating in the COMPANY affiliate network and performing your obligations here
                            under.</p>

                            resident in the United States of America; therefore you must ensure that your site does not
                            target players in these countries.</p>
                        <h4>COMPANY AFFILIATE OBLIGATIONS</h4>

                            accordance with the terms and conditions of this agreement.</p>
                        <p>You shall ensure (and take adequate and appropriate measures to ensure) that the players
                            referred by you to us are of the age of majority to participate in the services and that
                            they shall comply with the COMPANY general terms and conditions.</p>
                        <p>Referrals from affiliates are considered COMPANY players. The affiliate relinquishes all
                            rights and/or ownership to these players once referred to COMPANY and these players shall be
                            registered as COMPANY members before they are considered qualified acquisitions (subject to
                            any other applicable criteria).</p>
                        <p>You will be solely responsible for the development, operation, and maintenance of your site
                            and for your own materials that appear on your site. For example, you will be solely
                            responsible for ensuring that materials posted on your site are not libelous,
                            discriminatory, defamatory, offensive or otherwise illegal. COMPANY disclaims all liability
                            for these matters. Further, you will indemnify and hold us harmless from all claims,
                            damages, and expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees) arising directly or
                            indirectly out of the development, operation, maintenance, and contents of your site.</p>
                        <p>The COMPANY affiliate network is intended for your direct participation. You shall not open
                            affiliate accounts on behalf of third parties. Opening an affiliate account for third
                            parties, brokering an affiliate account or the transfer of an affiliate account are
                            prohibited. Affiliates wishing to transfer an affiliate account to another beneficial
                            account owner must request in writing, approval from COMPANY.</p>
                        <p>Approval is solely at COMPANY's discretion.</p>
